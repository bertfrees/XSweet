XSLT stylesheet version 2.0 (4 templates)

XSweet: Digests into a single-file "report" format an HTML file, to show its output (result structures) for diagnostics.

Input: An HTML file probably "HTML Typescript" in spirit (i.e. the fairly cleanish output of an XSweet extraction pipeline).

Output: An HTML file (open in a plain-ordinary browser) documenting a 'structural synopsis' of the HTML as given.

Note: For diagnostic purposes, this is rude but useful. Also could be extended and polished for better results.
